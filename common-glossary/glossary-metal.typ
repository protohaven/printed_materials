    Chips: (
        description: [
            The small curls of metal that form during efficient cutting. The quality of a cut can be determined by the size and color fo the chips produced.
        ]
    ),
    "Cutting Fluid": (
        description: [
            Specially engineered fluids that help increase the "bite" of drills and saws. Cutting fluids will also help keep the work from overheating, which will improve the efficiency of the cut and prolong tool life.
        ]
    ),
    "Steel, Cold-Rolled": (
        description: [
            Steel processed to strict dimensions and a smooth finish. Good for crisp, professional looks.
        ]
    ),
    "Steel, Hot-Rolled": (
        description: [
            Roughly processed steel with uneven surfaces. Good for rustic looking projects. The millscale is hard on cutting edges.
        ]
    ),
    "Steel, Mild": (
        description: [
            A common alloy of low carbon content. Mild steel is a relatively soft steel and does not heat harden. 
            
            Materials harder than mild steel should not be cut on Protohaven machines, which use baldes that will be damaged by harder materials.
        ]
    ),
    Swarf: (
        description: [
            Chips and dust carried away from the workpiece by the saw blade during the cut.
        ]
    ),
