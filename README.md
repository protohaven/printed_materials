# printed_materials

Typst-based documentation and other printed materials for Protohaven.

This monorepo holds all of the sources and supporting material to produce printed, paginated documentation for Protohaven.

## Repositories

### public-code_of_conduct/

This repo is mainly used as an inclusion for the member guide; we may want this content to live elsewhere.

### public-member_guide/

Member guide edit (WIP)

### class-handouts/

Printable class materials for Protohaven students.

### class-instructor_notes/

This is highly likely going to be elsewhere (does not necessarily need to be a paginated document)

### common-graphics/

Common graphics used across all document sets: branding imagery, etc.

### common-policy/

Inclusions used across the entire document set.

### meta-environments/

Configuration files for the document set, 

### events-handouts/

Printables: flyers, etc.

### events-setup_notes/

Might be valuable as printed documentation (physical artifacts are useful in the field)? This may want to live elsewhere.

### extra_resources/

Anything else that's valuable for the authors of this document set, and we want to keep track of it.

### reference/

Reference materials used across the entire document set: data tables and other structured data.
