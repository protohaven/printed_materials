= Filing a Tool Report

If you are using a tool, and the tool becomes unsafe, damaged, or is not working properly, you must notify a tech. The tech may instruct you to submit a tool report:

Notifying the tech will help us keep signage up to date, and make sure the users who come in after you have all the information they need to use the tool safely, even if they don't use discord.
