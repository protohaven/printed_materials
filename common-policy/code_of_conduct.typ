= Core Values

Protohaven supports a maker space that values:

*Inclusion:* We strive to create an environment where all feel welcome and are treated with dignity and respect.

*Empowerment:* We share our knowledge, resources, tools, and space to build the capacity of others.

*Collaboration:* We are a shared learning community that offers various levels of engagement to honor the creative aspirations of everyone.

*Agility:* We shift our focus and resources based on the needs of our members and the community.

*Sustainability:* We intentionally plan for the financial future of our organization and the environmental future of our planet.

= Community Guidelines

We ask that our members:

+ *Be Respectful:* 
  Our students, members, instructors, Shop Techs, and partners bring with them a rich variety of experiences, perspectives, and aspirations. 
  What brings us together is a shared interest in the process of making things. 
  To create a welcoming, supportive environment, we ask each individual to treat one another with care and openness to diversity of race, gender, orientation, age, identity, and ability.

+ *Take Responsibility:* 
  Protohaven is built around shared resources — space, tools, knowledge, and the community itself. 
  To preserve these communal assets, each individual is asked to take responsibility for their own actions and to be mindful of how they impact those around them. 
  We are each accountable for ourselves, and don’t expect others to bear the costs of our actions.

+ *Help Out:* 
  Protohaven is a public charity and is made possible only by people giving more than they take.
  In this spirit, we ask each individual to find opportunities to help each other, the organization, and our broader community. 
  We also ask each individual to recognize that assistance is not always sought, to seek consent before providing aid, and to provide opportunity for others’ work and discovery.
