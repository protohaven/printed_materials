== Before Coming to Protohaven
<covid-before-coming>

Before coming to Protohaven, we ask everyone to verify that you:

+ Pass a self-screen for common Covid symptoms, meaning:

  - No fever 
  - No cough or shortness of breath 
  - No change in sense of taste or smell, and

+ Have not had close contact with someone who has tested positive for
  Covid in the last 10 days

+ Use the online calendar to schedule a time to visit the shop, so we
  have a record of all visitors

If someone has had symptoms or contact, we ask that they not return to
the shop until they either receive a negative Covid test result, or wait
10 days after their last symptoms or contact.

== While at Protohaven
<covid-at-protohaven>

While using the shop, we ask you to:

- Wear a face mask (N95 if possible) if you are not vaccinated 
- Maintain six feet social distance from others 
- Regularly wash their hands 
- Carry a supplied cleaning kit and wipe down commonly-touched surfaces
  before and after use

== After Leaving Protohaven
<covid-after-leaving>

If, after leaving the shop, a visitor develops common Covid symptoms, we
ask that they get tested for Covid-19 and share the results with us.
This allows us to take the appropriate cleaning, testing, and
notification measures if the test comes back positive.
