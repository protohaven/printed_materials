#  Safety

No long sleeves - securely above elbows

No long hair, no flapping or dangling clothing

NO GLOVES - no gloves near anything that rotates

(Nothing that will pull you toward the spinning death ball)



# Materials

We have cooling cups by the grinders with water, but water does start the corrosion process

# Metal Chop Saw

Be careful with this one

Don’t put wood shop pressure on this; the idea is to take light chips/shavings, not grind through.

Don’t use this for 45° angles 

Place the part so the blade catches it on the down or through swing, not on the upswing

Only manipulate the saw unplugged

Several chipped teeth in the row, need to change the blade

We have a 14” blade, but the signage on the saw lists capacities for a 15” blade

The blue arm: lift to ratchet it

Clamp are has a swing for quick release

Use of chop saw clamping block for cutting angle iron

Use v-block for cutting rebar and other cylindrical/rounded workpieces

Not bolted down - more reason to keep it unplugged when messing with it

Make sure folks aren’t downrange (by the genders)

The cut will feel different

Run button is set up to 

## Setting up the machine

Check to make sure there are no chipped teeth.


## Work Holding

- Make sure the workplace is secure.
- Make sure the workpiece doesn’t rack in the clamp.
- Make sure the workpiece is down on the table.
- Make sure the back clamp is set and clamped.
- Make sure the front clamp is tight.

Check both ends of the workpiece is secure.

Bring the unpowered saw blade down on the workpiece to check the cut.

## Operating the machine

+ Plug in the machine. \
  _Do NOT out the electrical drop on the table of the table saw_
+ ONLY USE THE RIGHT HAND TO OPERATE THE SAW (keep body away from cut)
+ Go slowly!
+ Let the blade slow down before removing the the work piece
+ Do not let go of the handle until the blade comes to a complete stop?

## Cleanup

Use chip brushes and dust pans.

# Bandsaw

Materials, either steel or aluminum.

Cut and weld the bandsaw blades with the blade station:

- cut
- weld
- grind



## Setting up

Choose aluminum/steel speed with the level (make sure it clicks in - you may need to manually advance the wheel to get the gearing to seat - open the back door)

Use the speed and pitch chart on the inside of the door

(We have highlighted the metals we’re not allowed to use :) )

Get the guard as low as possible to the workpiece - turn the guard screw, lower the guard, tighten the guard screw. The guard is heavy; be careful.

Be careful that the blade is aligned with the guides (the guides haven’t moved)

Turn on the light

## Workholding

Use the fence.

Hold with both hands if you can

## Running the machine

Go slowly, consistently

“Wait until you can count the teeth” - wait until the blade stops moving completely before taking attention off of it.

## Cleaning Up

Use the chip brush.

Turn off the light.

# Drill Press

Workholding is critical; if the piece gets loose, it turns into a swing arm. (“Helicopter blade” - metal is very dangerous.)


## Setting up

Turn on the light

Clear off table of tools

Putting in the bit:

+ Close the chuck all the way
+ Open it just enough
+ Put in bit
+ Make sure the bit is true

Keyless chuck; just tighten it up

Adjust the speed if needed (up top - adjust the belts)

Belt change procedure; undo thumbscrews, release tension lever, swap belts, engage tension lever, tighten thumbscrews

## Workholding

Set up the workpiece so the bit doesn’t hit the table (or his sacrificial wood, etc.)

Use the t screws to clamp the case in place.

Or use the t screw and clamps to anchor the work to the table

Table raises and lowers, locks into place. - Adjust the table to make sure the bit will find a void/sacrificial piece

## Using

Turn on motor
Apply pressure to run the bit through the workpiece
Turn off motor

## Cleaning up

Chip brush
Turn off light

# Grinders

(East to west)

- wire brush (anything)
- aluminum

- heavy grit
- light grit

Do not walk away form the machine until it’s at a stop

If the wire brush causes the workpiece to jitter, pull back, find a different angle, and try again (or push in less) 

## Setting up

Adjust guide and shield

Check wheel for chips



## Workholding

Hold piece against guide

DO NOT let piece dive between he guide and the wheel

## Using

Turn on Vac

Move piece slowly and consistently against the wheel

## Cleaning Up

Turn off vac


# Disk sander/grinder

Always check the entire surface of the grinding surface for tears

NO GLOVES

DO NOT WEAR GLOVES USING THIS MACHINE

NO GLOVES

Do not walk away form the machine until it’s at a stop

## Setting up

- pull back shield, look for any voids in the grinding surface

## Workholding

Firmly grasp

Don’t let it dive

Use vice grips? No!

Keep piece pressed against the table

## Using

Only use on the right (downward side) of the tool.

Use brake (gently!)

## Cleaning Up



# Presses

(Katie already has presses)

(Check with Cord or Karen about presses)

# In the forge area: Abrasive Chop Saw

Use next to the open garage door/closed garage door (sparks on metal)

Set up for 45° cuts (that’s what it’s for)

Tightly attach workpiece in clamp

Check where the blade hits the piece

Thumb button holds the saw in the on position

Tightening wrench in compartment at the side

Makes the piece hot, can melt light work

Mild steel - support type things - rebar, angle iron

How do we change the wheel on this?

Causes a lot of vibration - don’t keep stuff on the table

## Setting Up

Position the saw so that the back is to the garage doors (open or not)
