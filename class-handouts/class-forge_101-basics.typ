= Class Safety

*Wear PPE in the smithy.* Make sure you have eye and hearing protection, and are not wearing any clothing that could melt and stick to your skin.

*Assume worked metal is too hot to touch with bare skin.* Be very careful picking up metal in the forge, unless you know it has been cooled in the quench tub.

*Be aware of your surroundings.* When working alone in the smithy, set up the workspace so that everything you need is in easy reach. When working with others in the smithy, make sure you do not put them in danger.

If you feel unsure of something, feel free to ask!

= Introduction

In the smithy, several tools are used together to work mild steel into useful shapes.

We use the forge to heat the material, the anvil or the vise as shaping platforms, and various tongs and hammers to work the metal by flattening, bending, or twisting.

== Learning Objectives

- Start the forge.
- Manipulate heated metal with hand tools.
- Shutdown the forge.
