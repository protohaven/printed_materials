LightBurn is only available on the desktops dedicated for use with the lasers. 

LightBurn is capable of handling all stages of a laser project, from art design through to running the job on the laser.

LightBurn can also import vector and raster art from other sources: you can work on your project in other software and then import it into LightBurn when you're ready to run the job.
