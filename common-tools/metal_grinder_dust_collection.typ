= Metal Shop Dust Collection (Grinder Area)

Dust collection is an important part of any shop. Dust is a health hazard: dust is an irritant, and specific sizes of dust particles (PM2.5) can lodge in the lungs and accumulate there, leading to long-term and possibly severe health issues. Dust is also hard on metal tools, and can encourage surface rust and pitting. 

== Notes

=== Safety

Always use the metal grinder dust collector when using the bench grinders or the disk grinder.

Check the ducting from the metal dust collector to the grinders. Make sure all of the ducts are attached firmly to the grinders.
