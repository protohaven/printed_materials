= Router Table

The router table can be used to profile an edge of a workpiece, or cut a channel in the face of a board.

== Notes

=== Safety

Always pass the workpiece across the bit from the right to the left.

#safety_hazard_box([DO NOT let the workpiece pass between the fence and the bit.
  
If the workpiece passes between the fence and the bit, the workpiece is likely to catch on the bit and be kicked violently off of the table into the shop, possibly causing injury or damage.  
])

=== On/Off Switch

Use the *green button* to turn on the machine.

Use the *red paddle* to turn off the machine.

The red paddle acts as the emergency stop button on the router table.

=== Throat Plate

The through plate sits in the router opening in table, and supports the material as it gets close to the bit.

There are several throat plates available in the Router Table Kit that work with router bits of varying sizes. 
Use a throat plate that is as close to the size of the router bit as possible while allowing the router bit to freely turn within the throat plate. 

=== Lifting Arm

Use the router lifting arm for large adjustments in the height of the router.

The lifting arm is keyed to the lifting assembly within the table. 
See @adjusting-router_bit_height for instructions on using the lifting arm. 

=== Fine Height Adjustment Dial

The fine height adjustment dial raises and lowers the router very slowly. 
Use the fine adjustment tool to dial in the router bit height for fine work.

=== Collet

The collet accepts the shaft of the bit.
Tightening the collet will lock the bit into place.

Always tighten the collet *very firmly* before turning on the router.

=== Bit

The bit spins against the workpiece to remove material.

There are many kinds and shapes of bits for treating edges: bits are available to chamfer or round edges, cut rabbets, make ogee cuts, or even complicated geometries for sash work. 
Router bits are also available to cut channels (straight, sliding dovetails, etc.). 
A set of various router bits is available at the front desk for member use.

=== Bearing

Some bits have a bearing at the top of the bit.

The bearing acts as a stop, and limits the depth of cut. 
Test the bit with scrap material to make sure that the workpiece properly engages with the bearing.

=== Fence

The fence can be set as a reference surface on the router table. 

The fence can be set in line with the bit to limit the depth of cut when using bits that do not have a bearing. 
The fence can also be set to precisely cut a channel in a workpiece.

=== Shop Vac

The router table has a dedicated shop vac for dust collection.

In normal use, the shop vac hose is connected to the port on the back of the fence.
The hose can be removed to help pick up chips and dust on the floor around the router table.
Always reattach the shop vac hose to the router fence after cleaning the area.

== Basic Operation

=== Setting Up

Checkout the Router Table Kit from the front desk.

If you do not have your own router bits, checkout the router bit set from the front desk.

Lift the router to its highest position:

// Kudos to Bobby K. for assistance in puzzling this one out! -PGM

+ Stand in front of the router table. \
  _ Face the side of the table that has the power switch._
+ Insert lifting arm.\
  _The lifting arm is stored in a tube attached to the top of the Router Table Kit._ 
+ Rotate the lifting arm so that the black rubber handle is parallel to the track, pointing to the left, as shown in @router-table-height-adjust.
+ Push down the lifting arm to engage it with the lifter.
+ Rotate the lifting arm 90째 clockwise, so that the black rubber handle is pointing away from you.
+ Pull up on the lifting arm to raise the router to its highest position. \
  _The router may already be in its highest position._

Secure the bit in the router:

+ Attach an appropriate collet (1/4" or 1/2") for the bit in use. \
  _Both collets should be in the Router Table Kit._
+ Place bit in collet.\ 
  _If any coatings are present on the bit, ensure that the collet is not in contact with the coating. The collet should be making firm contact with only the metal shaft of the bit._
  // ??? Illustrate this?
+ Tighten the collet.\
  _Use the wrenches in the Router Table Kit._
  
Insert the throat plate:  
  
+ Lower the router using the lift arm.
+ Insert the appropriate throat plate for the bit in use.\
  _Various throat plates are available in the Router Table Kit._
+ Raise the router such that the router bit is at an appropriate cutting height.\
  _Make sure there is clearance between the router bit and the throat plate._

Release the lifting arm:

+ Rotate the lifting arm 90째 counter-clockwise to release the lifting arm.
+ Remove the lifting arm from the router table. 

Set up and clear the table:

- If using the fence to register your workpiece, securely lock the fence in place to make sure it does not move during a cut.
- Clear away any setup tools (lifting arm, Allen wrench, collet wrenches) off of the table and put them back in the kit.

=== Adjusting the Bit Height
<adjusting-router_bit_height>

// Illustrate these things?

The lifting arm can be used for large adjustments of the bit height:

+ Stand in front of the router table. \
  _ Face the side of the table that has the power switch._
+ Insert lifting arm.\
  _The lifting arm is stored in a tube attached to the top of the Router Table Kit._ 
+ Rotate the lifting arm so that the black rubber handle is parallel to the track, pointing to the left, as shown in @router-table-height-adjust.
+ Push down the lifting arm to engage it with the lifter.
+ Rotate the lifting arm 90째 clockwise, so that the black rubber handle is pointing away from you.
+ Pull up or push down on the lifting arm to change the router position. \
  _This takes a good amount of force._
+ Rotate the lifting arm 90째 counter-clockwise to release the lifting arm.
+ Remove the lifting arm from the router table. 

Make fine adjustments to the bit height with the fine adjustment dial:

+ Unlock the fine adjustment dial.\
  _The appropriate Allen wrench is included in the Router Table Kit._
+ Adjust the bit height.
+ Lock the fine adjustment dial.

=== Workholding

The workpiece must be held down firmly against the table at all times.

The workpiece is held against the fence or a bearing on the bit.

Make sure the fence is firmly held down against the table.

Test fit the workpiece (or appropriate scrap) to make sure the workpiece will properly register against the bearing or the fence.

#warning([DO NOT let the workpiece pass between the fence and the bit. The workpiece may catch on the bit and be violently ejected from the router table.])

=== Making the Cut

+ Attach the shop vac to the router table fence, if needed.
+ Turn on the shop vac.
+ Make sure the router table is free of any loose materials: cut offs, tools, etc.
+ Using push pads to keep your hands clear of the bit, pass the workpiece across the bit, moving the workpiece from right to left.
  - If you are profiling an edge, keep the working edge pressed firmly against       either the bit bearing or the fence during the pass.
  - If you are making a channel cut, keep the workpiece pressed firmly against the   fence during the pass.
+ Depending on the material and the depth of cut, adjust pressure and speed for a clean cut. \
  _Cutoffs and other waste scraps are good for testing router setups with specific materials._

When finished cutting, turn off the router and the shop vac.

=== Cleaning Up

+ Unplug the router table.
+ Remove throat plate and return it to the Router Table Box.
+ Raise the router to its highest position.
+ Loosen the collet with the wrenches in the Router Table Kit.
+ Return the wrenches to the Router Table Kit.
+ Remove the bit from the collet. \
  _If you are using a shop bit, return the bit to its case._
+ Put the collet in the Router Table Kit.
+ Sweep up any dust and chips. \ 
  _Disconnect the shop vac to pickup floor sweepings and clean out the track and the fence. Reconnect the shop vac to the fence when finished._
+ Return the Router Table Kit to the front desk.\
  _If you borrowed shop router bits, bring them back, too!_
