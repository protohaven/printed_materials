== Usage Notes

=== Safety

- Keep hands three inches from the moving drill bit
- Always clamp to table
- Long stock should be braced securely

=== Care

- Do not use excessive force
- Never leave the chuck key in the chuck
- Submit a maintenance request when needed

=== Cleanup

Basic Anatomy
Table
Table adjustment handle
– used to adjust the height of the table
– unlock the table support lock before adjusting the height.
Table support lock
– locks the table at the current height and position around the column.
– always lock the table in place before drilling
Chuck
Chuck key
– used to open and close the fingers of the chuck
Quill
Feed handles
– used to move the chuck up and down to perform the drilling process
Pulleys
– used to select the speed at which the spindle turns
– Larger bits should be run slower than smaller bits
– Always unplug the machine before changing the pulley configuration.



CARE CLEANUP

1. Sweep the floor and vacuum debris
2. Recycle waste in the scrap bin
3. Empty scrap bin and dust collection when full
  – used to support the work piece. Make sure not to drill into the table surface.
– holds the drill bit. The bit should be centered relative to all three fingers. – do not attempt to drill if the bit does not spin true.
– always unplug the machine before inserting or removing a drill bit.
– contains the rotating spindle and moves up and downBelt guard
– Keeps dust and body parts away from the pulleys. Should be closed when the
machine is plugged in, and especially when running.
Tension lock
– loosen to give slack to the pulleys when changing the speed. Tighten to lock the
pulleys into position
Depth scale
– shows the depth of the hole being drilled
Bevel scale
– shows the angle of the table
Bevel lock
– locks the table to the angle shown on the bevel scale
Power switch
– turns the motor on and off
Drill bit
– performs the actual removal of material
– only sharp bits should be used to prevent binding and heat generation
– will often be hot after drilling a hole. Use caution when removing a recently used drill bit to prevent burns
Drill Press Safety
1. Keep hands at least 3 inches away from the bit when drilling. A bit can fragment, or throw the head sideways.
2. Always clamp work to the table. Your fingers are not stronger than the motor and you can be seriously injured if the bit binds in the hole.
3. Long stock should be braced against the column to prevent it from spinning into the operator.
4. Never leave the chuck key in the chuck. It can be flung from a spinning chuck and cause injury.
5. Do not use excessive force on the feed handle or you risk breaking the bit.
Basic Operation
● When drilling deep, periodically lift the bit to clear the swarf from the hole and flutes
● Center punching the location of a hole will help keep a drill bit from wandering
● When drilling large holes, a pilot hole will help larger chisel-tip bits cut properly
● Placing a sacrificial piece of stock below the workpiece can help prevent tearout
● If drilling thick material, drilling from both sides using a pilot hole as a positioning guide can also be useful
