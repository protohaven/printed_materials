= Belt/Disc Sander

The belt/disc sander is useful for refining outside edges of a workpiece. The abrasive surfaces can bring an edge down to a desired profile, as well as round over corners.

== Notes

=== Safety

- Keep fingers a minimum of three inches from moving abrasive surfaces
- Do not sand on the up (right) side of the disk sander
- Position the workpiece so that it will not kick back during sanding
- Sand with the direction of the grain
- Do not use to sand work that is too small to properly support or large work that is improperly supported
- Thin stock may be pulled into the gap between the abrasive and the support table. Keep thin stock flat against the table, or perpendicular to the table.

=== Care

- Allow abrasive to sand at it’s own pace. Don’t force it
- Alert a staff member if the abrasive is overworn
- Submit a maintenance request when needed

// Make maintantence requests an inclusion?

=== Cleanup

- Sweep the floor and vacuum debris
- Recycle waste in the scrap bin
- Empty scrap bin and dust collection when full
