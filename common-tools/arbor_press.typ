== Notes

=== Safety

Always wear safety goggles.

Keep fingers free of the crushing area.

=== Common Hazards

Parts compressed off axis may fly sideways out of the press.

Material that shatters under compression will fling debris out of the press at high speed.

=== Care

Do not use extension bars on the pulling handle to generate more force in the press.

(Keep press lubricated?)
