= Woodshop Dust Collection

Dust collection is an important part of any shop. Dust is a health hazard: dust is an irritant, and specific sizes of dust particles (PM2.5) can lodge in the lungs and accumulate there, leading to long-term and possibly severe health issues. Dust is also hard on metal tools, and can encourage surface rust and pitting.

== Notes

Run the dust collection system when using any connected power tool.

Open the appropriate blast gates to insure air flow.

Keep unused blast gates closed to maximize airflow where it is needed.

The dust collection system also has three floor inlets, one next to the miter saw, and one behind the resaw bandsaw and one next to the drill press. These are useful for collecting floor sweepings.

Empty the dust collection bin when it becomes two-thirds full (at the seam). Running the dust collection system with an over-capacity bin will reduce system performance.

== Parts of the Dust Collection System

=== Control panel

The control panel has power switches of the dust collection system.

=== System Power Switch

The system power switch turns power on and off to the entire dust collection system, including the control panel. #warning("DO NOT USE THIS SWITCH.") This switch should remain on at all times during open shop hours.

=== Blower Switch

The blower switch turns on the blowers that pull air through the system, collecting dust.

=== Dust Collection Bin

The dust collection bin holds all of the sawdust and light chips pulled in by the dust collection system. The lid is held in place by clamps.

== Basic Operation

=== Turning On The Dust Collection

Press the blower switch while the dust collection system is off.

=== Turning Off The Dust Collection

Press the blower switch while the dust collection system is on.

== Maintenance

If the dust collection bin becomes full:

+ Stop the dust collection blowers with the blower switch.
+ Unclamp the lip of the dust collection bin.
+ Remove waste from the bin.\
  _Scoop out waste into a wood shop trash can, and then roll the trashcan out to the dumpster and tip it in. If you need help lifting the bin up to the mouth of the dumpster, please ask!_
+ Replace the dust collection bin lid, and secure the clamps. \
  _Ensure the gasket is attached._
+ If the wood shop is in use and dust collection is still needed, turn the blowers back on.
