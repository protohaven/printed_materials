= Metal Chop Saw

The metal chop saw is a power tool suited for making cuts through thin stock: square rod, round rod, angle iron, or square tube.
This tool is best for shallow cutting angles. 

The metal chop saw can be very dangerous: be very careful using this tool. 


== Notes

=== Safety

#safety_hazard_box([*No freehand cuts.* Freehand cutting is a major cause of accidents and should not be attempted.])

Be mindful of the area to the right of the metal chop saw; waste pieces may go in that direction after a cut is complete. Be extra careful if another shop member is using the metal drill press or grinders.

Do not use the metal chop saw to cut small pieces. If the cut will cause your fingers to be within 150mm of the saw blade, the workpiece is too small.

Do not make cuts that produce waste pieces smaller than 8mm (5/16") in length. The waste piece must be 8mm (5/16") or greater  to avoid the piece falling through the blade slot and causing any potential danger.

Don’t use the metal chop saw for 45° angle cuts. Use this saw for cuts close to or at 90°.

When making a cut, only let the blade approach the workpiece from the back or from the top. Do not let the workpiece touch the back part of the blade where the teeth are traveling upward: the teeth may pull the workpiece up and out of the vise.

The metal chop saw is not bolted down. // - more reason to keep it unplugged when messing with it

Unplug the saw while setting up a workpiece or performing any maintenance.

=== Use

If you see several chipped teeth in a row during the blade inspection step, the blade needs to be replaced: please inform a tech on duty.

We have a 14” blade, but the signage on the saw lists capacities for a 15” blade. Be conservative.

Apply gentle pressure during a cut. The idea is to take light chips or shavings with the cutting heads, not grind through the workpiece. Applying excess pressure will not make the machine perform any better, and may reduce the lifetime of the motor and the blade.

=== Lower Blade Guard

The lower blade guard will automatically retract as the saw is lowered into the cut, and then automatically cover the blade as the saw is lifted from the cut.

Do not hold the lower blade guard open.

=== Upper Blade Guard

The upper blade guard is fixed in position to cover the top half of the blade at all times when in use.

=== Handwheel

The handwheel tightens or loosens the vice jaws.

=== Quick Release Mechanism

The quick release mechanism releases the clamping screw on the front vice jaw, so that the front swiveling jive jaw can be quickly adjusted.

Lift the blue handle to slide the front vice jaw away form or into the workpiece. Always replace the quick release mechanism before using the saw to make sure proper camping force is being applied to the workpiece.

=== Front Swiveling Vice Jaw

The front vise jaw can swivel to accommodate workpieces held at an angle.

Always make sure the front vice jaw has stable and full contact with the workpiece; see @chop_saw_metal-workholding for more information about workholding with this tool.

=== Repositionable Rear Vice Jaw

The rear vise jaw can be locked into position to accommodate workpieces held at an angle.

Always make sure the rear vice jaw has stable and full contact with the workpiece; see @chop_saw_metal-workholding for more information about workholding with this tool.

=== Cutting Handle

Use the cutting handle to lower the cutting head into the work piece. 

Only use the cutting handle with your right hand.

// === Cutting Head Hold Down Pin
// 
// (Push/pull) the cutting head hold down pin to lock the cutting head in the lowered position.
// 
// Locking the head in the lowered position is useful for transporting the saw.

=== Rear Vice Jaw Locking Lever

The rear vice jaw locking lever locks the rear vice jaw into place. 

// === Travel Stop Adjustment Screw
// 


=== Protractor Scale

Use the protractor scale to align the rear vice jaw to an angle. 

Set the rear vice jaw at an angle to make angled cuts. #warning([Do not set the rear vice jaw to an angle more/less than n degrees; to shallow/steep of an angle may cause the cutoff to fly away from the machine.])

=== On/Off Trigger Switch

The on/off switch has two parts: the safety lock and the trigger switch. The safety lock is the button under the thumb when gripping the handle, and must be pressed to turn on the saw. The trigger switch is on the inside of the handle. 

To turn on the motor, depress the safety lock, then squeeze the trigger switch.

// === Carry Handle



=== Chip Collection Tray

The chip collection tray catches chips and dust that are ejects downward out of the cut. 

Check the chip collection tray for any material that extends into the cutting area, and might interfere with a cut. Clear out any interfering material before making a cut.


== Basic Operation

=== Workholding
<chop_saw_metal-workholding>

- Clear the machine of swarf and dust before clamping the workpiece.
- Make sure the workplace is secure.
- Make sure the workpiece doesn’t rack in the clamp.
- Make sure the workpiece is is full contact with the table. \
  _If the piece drops during the cut, it could rack and move into the blade._
- Make sure the front clamp is tight.
- Make sure the back clamp is set and clamped.

Check that *both* ends of the workpiece are secure in the vise (not just the end near the blade).

Bring the unpowered saw blade down on the workpiece to check position of the cut:

- Make sure the cut is positioned where you want it on the workpiece.
- Secure the part so the blade catches it on the down or through swing, not on the upswing.
- Make sure the waste piece is at least 8mm (5/16") in length.


=== Setting Up

Inspect the entire blade for chipped teeth. 

Clean the clamps and table before securing the workpiece. Make sure the clamping area is free of swarf and dust, and nothing will get on the clamping surfaces that may cause the workpiece to loosen of shift.

Ensure that the cut-off portion of the workpiece is free to move away from the blade at the end of the cut. Be very careful to make sure that the waste piece will not get jammed in the clamping area, against the blade, or in any other part of the machine.

Ensure that the workpiece is held securely in the vise. (see @chop_saw_metal-workholding)

Check to make sure no one is nearby who could get hit by a flying waste piece.

=== Making a Cut

+ Plug in the machine. \
  _Do NOT put the electrical box on the table of the drill press._
+ *Only use the right hand to operate the saw.* \
  _Keep your body away from cut, and out of the path of any flying debris._
+ With the saw in a fully upright position, turn on the motor and let the blade come up to full speed.
+ Gently lower the saw blade toward the workpiece. Go slowly!
+ Gradually increase the pressure as the saw blade enters the workpiece.\
  _Do not force the saw blade into the workpiece. Let the saw blade do the work._
+ Adjust the cutting pressure to suit the material. \
  _Use the least amount of pressure needed to make the cut. Use more pressure to move the blade through thicker parts of the workpiece, less pressure to move the blade through thinner parts of the workpiece._
+ Reduce pressure as the blade begins to exit the material.
+ Upon completion of the cut, allow the saw blade assembly to rise completely into its upper position.
+ Turn off the motor.
+ Do not remove your hands or the workpiece from the tool until the blade has come to a complete stop and the blade is completely covered by the blade guard. 

=== Cleaning Up

- Use chip brushes and dust pans to clean up any swarf and dust.
- Pick up any waste pieces.
- Unplug the saw, and stow the power cable.
