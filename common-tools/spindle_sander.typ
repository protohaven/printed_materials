== Usage Notes


=== Safety

- Keep fingers a minimum of three inches from moving abrasive surfaces
- Do not sand on the up (right) side of the disk sander
- Position the workpiece so that it will not kick back during sanding
- Sand with the direction of the grain
- Do not use to sand work that is too small to properly support or large work that is improperly supported
- Thin stock may be pulled into the gap between the abrasive and the support table. Keep thin stock flat against the table, or perpendicular to the table.

=== Care

- Alert a staff member if the abrasive is overworn
