= Jointer

The _jointer_ (or in some countries a _surface planer_) can flatten the face of a board. The newly flattened face can then be presented to the fence to create a board with an edge square to the face.

== Notes

=== Safety

- Keep hands six inches from the cutter. 
- Never push on the workpiece above the cutter.

=== Care 
 
- *Do not adjust the outfeed table.* \
  _The machine will bind and kick back if it is not correctly adjusted to the height of the cutter._ 
- Watch for excessive chip ejection around the cutter and machine base. If a lot of chips are getting ejected, check the dust collection boot for build up, and clean the chute when needed.
- Do not cut engineered materials, splintered wood, or wood with knots on the jointer.\
  _These materials are prone to chipping, causing kickback and projectiles. Engineered materials are also particularly damaging to the cutters due to the staggered grain orientation._

=== On/Off/Emergency Buttons

Use the *green button* to turn on the machine.

Use the *red button* to turn off the machine.

The large red *emergency stop* button is designed to be easy to hit if you need to power off the machine quickly. If you use the emergency stop button, you must twist the emergency stop button to release it (the button is spring loaded, and will pop out when released). The machine will not run until the emergency stop button is released. 

During normal usage it is better to use the stop button instead of the emergency stop button.

=== Cutter

The cutter is a helical cutter head with many carbide inserts. 

Always maintain a safe distance from the cutter. Never push down on a workpiece over the cutter head; the workpiece may be kicked out of the machine, exposing the cutter heads to your hands.

=== Blade Guard

The blade guard covers the cutting head when there is no workpiece moving through the jointer. This style of guard is sometimes called a "pork chop" style guard due to its shape.

The guard should easily swing out of the way with the workpiece. If the guard does not easily move, *STOP*. Do not try to force the guard. Turn off the machine and alert a shop tech.

Do not try to prop the guard open or  open the guard manually while the cutter is moving.

=== Infeed Table

The infeed table holds the workpiece before it contacts the cutting head. Push the workpiece along the infeed table toward the cutting head to begin the cut.

The depth of cut is determined by how far the infeed table sits below the apex of the cutting head. 

=== Infeed Height Adjustment Crank

The infeed hight adjustment crank raises and lowers the infeed table to adjust how much material is taken off on each pass. Taking multiple light cuts is recommended for better control and quality of cut. 

In general, a cut depth greater than 1/8" is not recommended.

=== Fence 

The fence can be moved laterally to expose more or less of the cutting head, and angled with repsect to the outfeed table. 

Normally, the fence is set to be perpendicular to the plane of the outfeed table. Always check your desired angle with a quality square or gauge. 

The fence does not need to be perpendicular to the rotational axis of the cutter, only to the plane of the outfeed table.

=== Fence Position Lock

The fence position lock secures the fence's lateral position with respect to the cutting head.

*Do not move the fence without first unlocking it.* Always lock the fence after moving it to a new position.

=== Fence Angle Lock

Secures the fence angle with respect to the tables.

=== Fence Perpendicular Stop

Use this stop to quickly index the fence to the perpendicular. 


=== Outfeed Table

The outfeed table supports the workpiece after it has passed over the cutter. The height of the outfeed table should always match the apex of the cutting head.

=== Outfeed Height Adjustment Crank

*Do not use the outfeed hight adjustment crank.* This setting should _never_ be used unless the jointer is out of calibration and you are trained and have permission to do so.

== Basic Operation

=== Workholding

When face jointing, use pads to apply pressure straight down to keep the board in good contact with the table.

When edge jointing, use pads to apply pressure at a 45Â° angle to that the board is in good contact with both the table and the fence.

=== Setting Up

+ Turn on the dust collection.
+ Open the blast gate.
+ Adjust the depth of cut. \
  _Maximum cut of 1/16" for faces and 1/8" for edges._
+ Place the workpiece on the infeed table, with the widest, most stable surface facing the table.\
  _If the workpiece is cupped, place the cupped (concave) side facing down._
+ Turn on the motor.

=== Joint the Workpiece

+ Using a push block to gently keep the workpiece in contact with the infeed table and fence, begin pushing the workpiece across the cutter. \
  _Move the workpiece as smoothly as possible._
+ *Do not push down on the workpiece over the cutter.*\
  _Pushing down on the workpiece over the cutter will flex the warped wood flat during cutting, preventing the workpiece from becoming flat when released._
+ Once all of the workpiece is on the outfeed table, use a push pad to gently keep the workpiece in contact with the outfeed table and the fence. Use a push block on the tail end to gently push the work piece past the cutter with only light downward pressure.\
  _Keep your fingers free of the cutter._
+ Repeat until the surface is flat.\
  _Check for flat by checking for light when placing the workpiece on a known flat surface, or checking with a rule. If multiple passes does not seem to make progress toward flatness, this indicates that the outfeed table is misadjusted._

Flip the workpiece on its side so that the flat edge is against the fence, and repeat the jointing procedure to flatten the second edge. Test the corner with a square to make sure the corner is true. When edge jointing the fence is the most important reference surface.

=== Cleaning Up

+ Turn off the motor.
+ Sweep up any dust and/or shavings.\
  _There is a floor intake for the dust collection system on the wall behind the resaw bandsaw._
+ Close the blast gate.
+ Turn off the dust collection.\
  _If other members are still using the dust collector, leave it on._
