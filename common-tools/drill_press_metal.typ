= Metal Drill Press



== Notes

// General and specific to Protohaven

=== Safety

Keep workpiece firmly attached to the table at all times. If the workpiece becomes loose, it may lift up and begin to spin on the drill bit, creating a very dangerous cutting hazard.

=== Use

Drilling produces a lot of heat, and it's easy to overheat a drill bit when cutting for an extended period in a hard material. 
Go slowly, take frequent breaks, and use a good cutting oil to help cool the work and improve the cut.

=== Consumables

The are shop-use drill bits available in the shop cart by the metal band saw, and there is a drill bit set available for checkout at the front desk. 
If you need a particular bit size, or want to make fine cuts in a work piece, you may wish to invest in your own drill bit set.

=== On/Off Switch

Put the switch into the *on* position to turn on the drill.

Put the switch into the *off* position to turn off the drill.


=== Chuck

The chuck holds the drill bit in the spindle. 

The chuck uses a set of jaws, which tighten around the shaft of the bit. Always make sure that the bit is firmly held by all three jaws.

=== Depth Stop

The depth stop limits the amount of downward travel for the spindle. 

Set the depth stop to drill hols of a specific depth in a work piece.

=== Feed Handle

The feed handle lowers the spindle towards the workpiece.

=== Spindle

The spindle is driven by the motor to turn the chuck and the bit.

=== Table

The table supports the workpiece. The workpiece can be clamped to the table with the clamp set, or with the drill press vise.

=== Table Adjust Clamp

Use the table adjust clamp to reposition the table. With the table adjust clamp loose, the table can be swung from side to side or moved up and down the drill press post. 

Always make sure the table adjust clamp is fully tight before drilling a workpiece.

=== Belt Cover

At the top of the drill press, the belt cover protects the belt drive system. Make sure the belt cover is closed before turning on the drill press.

=== Motor Tension Lock Screw

There are two motor tension lock screws on either side of the drill cabinet. Loosen both screws to free the motor and enable the motor tension release lever.

Make sure the motor tension lock screws are firmly tightened before running the drill press.

=== Motor Tension Release Lever

The motor tension release lever pulls the motor into a slack position, so the drive belts can be repositioned. 

Always make sure the drive belts are under tension before running the drill press.

=== Clamp Set

At the base of the drill press is a clamp set for use with the drill press table. The clamp set offers various screws and clamping bars that can secure a workpiece to the table.

=== Drill Press Vise

At the base of the drill press is a drill press vise, which can hold a workpiece for drilling. The drill press vise must be clamped to the table using the clamp set to securely hold the workpiece.

The drill press vise is particularly useful for holding thin, flat stock. Always make sure that the workpiece is securely in the vise, and will not lift out and begin to spin on the drill bit.

== Basic Operation

=== Setting Up

Ready the work area:

+ Turn on the light.
+ Clear off table of tools.

Set the appropriate speed:

+ Open the top of the drill press.
+ Loosen the two motor slide lock screws.
+ Release the motor tension release lever.
+ Configure the belts for the appropriate cutting speed.
+ Set the motor tension release lever.
+ Tighten the two motor slide lock screws.
+ Close the top of the drill press.

Secure a bit in the chuck:

+ Close the jaws of the chuck all the way.
+ Open the jaws just enough to accept the bit.\
  _This will help keep the bit centered in the chuck._
+ Slide the bit up into the jaws of the chuck. 
+ Tighten the chuck.\
  _The metal drill press has a keyless chuck._
  
Briefly run the drill to make sure the bit is on axis.\
_The bit should not wobble when the drill is running._

If needed, set the depth stop to make sure the drill press stops cutting at a specific depth.

=== Workholding

#safety_hazard_box([Proper workholding is critical to the safe use of the metal drill press.
  
If the workpiece comes loose while the drill is running, the workpiece will rise up and begin to spin, becoming a very dangerous hazard for anyone nearby.

Always make sure that your workpiece is securely clamped to the table of the metal drill press.  
])

There is a clamp set stored at the base of the metal drill press which can be used to secure the workpiece to the table.

The clamp set can also be used to secure the table vise, which is useful for securing thin stock. 

=== Drilling

+ Turn on the drill.
+ Pull the feed handle with a slow firm pressure to advance the bit through the workpiece.\
  _Using cutting oil is recommended to control the temperature of the cut, and help carry away swarf._
+ Reduce feed pressure near the end of the cut.\
  _Do not drill into the table._
+ Turn off the drill.

If you are making a deep hole in the workpiece, you may wish to complete the cut in several passes.

=== Cleaning Up

+ Unclamp the workpiece from the table.
+ Clear off the table of tools and clamps.
+ Clean the table of swarf.
+ Turn off the light.
