= Resaw Band Saw

The _resaw band saw_ takes off slices of a board. Slices can vary in width from thick planks to thin veneers. A workpiece should have at least one flat face on the table in order to be stable during the cut.

One common use of the resaw band saw is to create bookmatched panels from a board.

== Notes

=== Safety

- Do not put round stock through the saw unsupported.\
  _When cutting cylinders, use a jig to prevent the workpiece from spinning or twisting, and to keep the workpiece orientation straight and true as the cut is made._
- Do not cut lumber that has nails or loose knots.

=== Care

- Tension the blade before use, if needed. \
  _The blade is under operating full tension at the 11 o'clock position._

=== On/Off/Emergency Buttons

Use the *green button* to turn on the machine.

Use the *red button* to turn off the machine.

The large red emergency stop button is designed to be easy to hit if you need to power off the machine quickly.

=== Tension Lever

Use the tension lever to apply or release tension on the blade. 

Before turning the saw on, always use the tension lever to put full tension on the blade.

=== Cabinet Doors

The cabinet doors cover the upper and lower wheels of the saw. 

Both the upper and the lower cabinet doors must be closed while operating the machine. 

The doors are an important safety feature: they prevent accidental contact with the blade, and will contain the majority of the blade when it breaks.

=== Blade Guard

The blade guard protects the blade, and can be adjusted to only expose enough of the blade to make the cut.

Unlock the blade guard to adjust the height. Set the guard at a height that will allow the workpiece to pass below it without making contact, but will prevent your hand from fitting between the bottom of the guard and the workpiece. 

=== Blade Guard Lock Knob

The blade guard lock knob engages the blade guard lock, keeping the blade guard from moving up and down. 

Loosen the blade guard lock knob to adjust the blade guard. Turning the crank without unlocking the knob will damage the gears.

Always tighten the blade guard lock knob before using the machine, to keep the blade guard from falling into the workpiece during a cut.

=== Thrust Guide

The thrust guide supports the back of the blade during the cut.

The thrust guide should be adjusted to create a gap of 1/64th of an inch (or less) behind the blade. The thrust guide should not make contact with the blade at idle. This gap provides a small amount of flex towards the rear, but prevents the blade from either rubbing against the guide when idling, or being pushed off the wheel during a cut.

=== Blade Guides

The blade guides keep the blade in proper position laterally, just above the workpiece. 

The blade guides should be positioned as close to the sides of the blade as possible without scraping the blade when idling. 

The front edge of the guides should be just behind the tooth profile of the blade. The blade guides should never extend into the teeth; the teeth will damage the blade guides.

=== Blade

The resaw blade is meant for straight cuts of large workpieces.

The blade has large tooth spacing, allowing thick stock to be cut without the swarf getting packed into the gullet. 

The workpiece should be checked to make sure that at least two teeth will be buried in the material at all times during the cut. If the workpiece is thinner than two teeth, running the saw can result in individual teeth getting knocked off the blade, damaging it irreparably. If a tooth is broken, power off the saw immediately and report the issue.

=== Table

The table supports the workpiece as it moves past the blade.

Anything put through the saw should have at least one flat surface that can be presented to the table. Any twisting of the material will result in the blade binding in the cut, breaking the blade, and possibly breaking critical parts of the machine. 

*Any workpiece that does not have at least one flat edge must be secured in a jig or sled* to safely perform a cut. Once a single cut has been made, the fresh edge can be used against the table for subsequent cuts.

=== Fence

Once a workpiece has two straight edges, use the fence to cut parallel slices off the workpiece. 
The fence supports and guides the workpiece past the blade.

Adjust the fence so that the cut is of an appropriate width by lifting the fence release lever and moving the fence. 
Once the fence is positioned, lock the fence in place by pushing down on the fence release lever.

)

Often a dull or misaligned blade will cause the workpiece to wander away from the fence, causing a crooked cut. 
Watch your cut carefully and support your workpiece firmly against the fence to prevent this.

=== Throat

The saw passes through the table via the throat.

Care should be taken to not push the blade laterally into the throat plate.

=== Push Stick

Use push sticks to move the work past the saw blade.

As you approach the end of a cut, you do not want your fingers to get close to the blade. Use a push stick to push your workpiece all the way past the blade. They are often sacrificial, and you can push the tip of the stick straight into the blade.

== Adjusting the Blade Guides

The resaw band saw has six blade guides to support the blade during a cut.

Above the table, there are three blade guides: an inner guide, and outer guide, and a rear guide. The inner and outer guides keep the blade from moving left or right. The rear blade guide supports the back of the blade during a cut, to keep it from being pushed off the wheels. 

An additional set of three blade guides in the same configuration support the blade below the table.

The adjust a blade guide:

+ Loosen the guide lock screw.
+ Turn the guide adjustment knob so that the guide spins freely when the blade turns. \
  _Do not overtighten the guides so that they clamp  the blade._
+ Tighten the guide lock screw.  

TODO: more notes on proper tolerances here. (check with Cord)

== Basic Operation

=== Work Holding

Apply pressure to keep the board firmly against the table and the fence.

=== Check the Blade

+ Put the blade in full tension.

=== Prepare the Machine

+ Check the table angle.\
  _For most cases, the table should be 90Â° to the blade._
+ Check the blade guides.
+ Loosen the blade guard lock knob.
+ Adjust the blade guard to just above the height of the workpiece.
+ Adjust the fence for the desired cut width.
+ Make sure there is sufficient support available on both the infeed and outfeed sides of the cut for the size of the workpiece.
+ Turn on dust collection.
+ Turn on the saw and let it spin up to full speed.
+ Check for blade drift.\
  _If the blade is drifting, stop the saw and alert a tech._

// do we want to explain drift in the glossary?
=== Making a Cut

#safety_hazard_box([
  If the blade binds in the cut, #warning([POWER THE MACHINE OFF IMMEDIATELY]). Keep the workpiece stable until the motor has been disconnected from the power and has stopped completely.

  Under normal use the blade will eventually break. This will usually be preceded by a rhythmic pulsing as a developing crack in the blade passes through the workpiece. If you experience this pulsing, stop and inspect the blade for damage. Inform a tech that the cracked blade should be removed from service immediately.

  Do not back out of a cut while the blade is running. The blade will be pulled off of the front edge of the wheels, creating a safety hazard and causing irreparable damage to the machine.
])

+ Holding the workpiece firmly against the table and the fence, feed the workpiece into the blade.
+ Feed slowly and consistently through the length of the cut.\
  _Make sure the workpiece does not twist or wander away from the fence._
+ As you reach the end of the cut, keep your fingers away from the blade.\
  _Use a push stick to feed the trailing end of the workpiece past the blade._

=== Cleaning Up

+ Turn off the saw.
+ Wait for the saw to come to a complete stop before leaving the area.
+ Sweep up any dust. \
  _There is a floor intake for the dust collection system on the wall behind the resaw band saw._
+ Turn off the dust collection system, if it is not otherwise in use.
