# Millwork Q&A, Notes

## Talking About the Stock

Q: What is it about non-flat wood that’s dangerous?

A: Table saw: wood can bind and kick back.

A: For the planer, we’d end up “skip planing” - wood will rock as it moves through, and you won’t get a flat surface.

A: Always go through the planer first.

A: If the board is too wide for the jointer, we may have to resort to skip planing anyway.

## Jointer

Always check the hight of the output table - must be level with the top of the cutter head.
 
Start with only a 16th of an inch. Taking off less material: smoother, easier cut.

Plan for moving toward a dimension.

“Bladeguard” or the “pork chop”

Check for the squareness of the table to the fence.

To adjust the angle of the fence, turn the fence release counter clockwise, adjust the fence, look for light under the rule of the square, check both both sides.

Q: Do we have tools in the shop to check for angles other than 45 and 90?

A: There’s a digital protractor by the desk.

Q: Do we need to worry about which way the grain is going?

A: 

“Whenever we’re surfacing the grain is important.”

“Don’t push down over the cutting head, you’ll take out a _snipe_, or a semi-circular cut in the surface.”

# Planer

Only a quarter turn.

“Like pasta!”

“If you’re taking light passes, you shouldn’t have to worry about tear-out as much.”

# Router Table

Router is mounted under the table, permanently plugged in to the control panel at the front of the router.

Get the router kit and bits from the front desk.

## Router

(Router is as dangerous as the table saw - lot of room for error, and an upbeat moving really fast  coming out of the table.)

The router is spinning on a vertical access.

Router is upside down - everything right to left (from the top, router is spinning counter clockwise.)

Router supports 1/4” and 1/2 bit shanks (two collets)

## Bits

(Router bit discussion - edge bits, rabbit bits, bearings work against the face.)

Q: Can bits be sharpened?

Hold bits below, or on the dark (non-sharp) part.

When clamping a bit in the collet, don’t clap to the coating, only metal-on-metal

Q: Will the router self-tighten when it’s running?

This router uses two wrenches to tighten/untighten

Set up wrenches so that you are pushing the wrecks together, not apart.

To tighten, turn the top wrench cw, bottom wrench CCW

TO loosen, turn the top wrench ccw, bottom wrench cw

- Tighten the bit in place.

(Monkey tight vs. gorilla tight)

Router adjustment handle: There is a tongue and groove on the bottom that rotates into a locking position in the throat of the router table.

Raise and lift with the handle at north/south?

The hight adjustment handle:

- Notch in the handle fits the jig 
- Once the handle is in raise and lower as needed.

All bits should be below the bottom of the board; bottom of the bit shouldn’t go above the bottom o the board (or: the bottom of the bit should never be proud of the table surface)

Safety: Never have the material between the bit and the fence. (Turns the workpiece into a projectile).

Use fence to support the workpiece - open for a bigger bit, closed for better support.

Add the throat plate.

Different sized throat plate depending on the size of the bit we’re using.

Use the two-prong tool to tighten the place (CCW tightens, CW loosens)

Unlock the micro adjustment, spin micro adjustment dial, lock micro adjust (Allen key in kit).

“I see no more wood in the black part.”

When you start at a corner, line the corner up just left of the center of the bit.

Use pads

Always move workpiece from right to left facing the router table.

- Turn on vacuum
- Adjust fence
- Turn on router
- Make a cut
- Turn off router
- turn off vacuum

Might be tearout due to grain or speed.

Moving too slowly may burn the surface.

TODO: What the guidance for the depth of cut vs. size of bit?

Body positioning: don’t put yourself in a position where you’re leaning over the router table.

Workholding: use pads to keep the workpiece pressed firmly against the table. Also use side pressure to keep the workpiece against the bearing or fence as needed
